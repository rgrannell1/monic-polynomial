# polynomial

This repository includes code to solve and graph large numbers of polynomial roots. It also includes code to deploy a DigitalOcean VM to run this code, since this task can raise a laptop's temperature to lightly knee-scortching.

## Background

This tool generates solutions to all polynomials of a fixed order, with coefficients in a certain integer range. After obtaining the complex solutions to these polynomials it plots their real / complex parts. The colour assigned to each root corresponds to the product of the polynomials coefficients.
